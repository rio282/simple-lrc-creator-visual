# Simple LRC Creator Visual

This application allows you to add and synchronize lyrics to MP3 files
in [LRC format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)).
It was primarily developed for personal use, helping users create and edit LRC files for their own music collection. The
app provides a visual waveform, a slider for precise timestamping, and a text area to type lyrics.
